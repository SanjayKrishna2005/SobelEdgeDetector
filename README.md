# FPGA-Based Sobel Edge Detection with Approximate Multipliers

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a fully synthesizable Sobel edge detection algorithm using Verilog HDL, suitable for FPGA deployment. The design uses a custom-built approximate unsigned multiplier to significantly reduce power & area consumption , while maintaining edge detection accuracy. It is capable of detecting edges from 8-bit grayscale images in real-time.

## ðŸ§± Modular Architecture

The project is built using a modular RTL architecture consisting of the following components:

- `pixel_window_generator.v` â€“ Generates a 3Ã—3 pixel window using FIFOs and shift registers  
- `sobel_core.v` â€“ Computes Gx and Gy gradients, absolute values, and applies thresholding  
- `Adder_16bit.v` â€“ Custom structural adder (Carry Select Adder)  
- `AppMul_8bitSigned.v` â€“ Approximate unsigned multiplier for power-aware convolution  
- `line_buffer.v` â€“ FIFO-based scanline buffering
- `tb_sobel_image.v` â€“ Testbench for simulating full image-based pipeline  
- **MATLAB Scripts** â€“ For image preprocessing and output visualization
